# Health Insurance Cost Analysis and Prediction

## Introduction
Health insurance costs have risen dramatically over the past decade in response to the rising cost of health care services and are determined by a multitude of factors. Let's look at the cost of healthcare for a sample of the population given age, sex, bmi, number of children, smoking habits, and region.

##### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine the contributing factors and predict health insurance cost by performing exploratory data analysis and predictive modelling on the Health Insurance dataset. This project makes use of Numpy, Pandas, Sci-kit learn, and Data Visualization libraries.
